# Welcome to Fallernetes Documentation

This projects main goal is to enable **game server management on Kubernetes**, allowing **deletion blocking** without adding complex logic to the game servers themselves. Additionally, it supports **custom autoscaling decisions** through **webhooks**.

## About the Documentation

The structure is kept intentionally simple:

- **Left sidebar**: Navigate between different pages of the documentation.
- **Right sidebar**: View the subsections of the current page.

Each page covers either:
- A **core part** of the project,
- **Usage instructions**, or
- An **architectural decision**, including its consequences and reasoning.
